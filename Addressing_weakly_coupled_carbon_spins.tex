\label{chap:addressing_weakly_coupled_carbons}

In order to realize quantum error correction we need at least three qubits and at least five to correct for a universal error.
\Cref{fig:coupling regimes} shows a schematic overview of spins in different coupling regimes.
Strongly coupled carbon spins can be controlled using the methods described in the previous chapter.
However the probability of finding enough of these spins to implement QEC is very small.
Additionally strongly coupled nuclear spins are prone to decohere when the electronic spin is optically addressed.
A problematic feature for QEC which relies on repeatedly measuring errors to be able to correct for them.

By addressing weakly coupled carbon spins the spin register can be enlarged with spins that are not affected as strongly by the readout of the electron spin.
However to address weakly coupled carbon spins the coherence of the electron needs to be extended.
This is done trough dynamical decoupling \citep{Lange2010Universal}.
Van der Sar et al. \citep{Sar2012DecoherenceProtected} have demonstrated how to integrate regular operations on the NV-spin with a dynamical decoupling sequence.
To address these weakly coupled carbon spins we use the dynamical decoupling sequence used to extend the coherence \citep{Taminiau2012Detection}.
In the next chapter it is demonstrated how this control is used to perform parity measurements and create entanglement.

In this chapter it will first be explained how the coherence can be extended trough dynamical decoupling so that weakly coupled carbon spins can be addressed.
The dynamical decoupling sequence will then be used to identify spins in the environment.
These spins are characterized so that they can be controlled in the next chapter.

    \caption{ Schematic representation of different coupling regimes. Carbons in region $\mathbb{I} $ are in the strong coupling regime, transitions of these spins can be readily resolved and they can be controlled using the methods described in the previous chapter.
    In the weak coupling regime (region $\mathbb{II}$) carbon-spins are coupled more strongly to the NV-center than to the spin-bath but not strong enough to be readily resolvable in an ESR. These spins can be controlled trough dynamical decoupling \citep{Taminiau2012Detection}.
    In the very-weak coupling regime (region $\mathbb{III}$) the coupling to the spin-bath is stronger than the coupling to the NV-center. These spins cannot presently be addressed.}
