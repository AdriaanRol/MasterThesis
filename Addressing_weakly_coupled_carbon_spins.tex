\chapter{Addressing Weakly-coupled Carbon Spins}
The spin register can be extended by addressing weakly-coupled spins.
This chapter will explain how coherence can be extended trough dynamical decoupling and how this can be used to address single carbon-spins.
The methods will be used to identify and characterize individual nuclear spins.

[NOTE: Maybe remove following paragraph and figure?]

\Cref{fig:coupling regimes} shows a schematic representation of different coupling regimes.
Carbons in region $\mathbb{I} $ are in the strong coupling regime, transitions of these spins can be readily resolved and they can be controlled using the methods described in the previous chapter.
By extending the coherence of the electronic spin certain weakly coupled spins can be controlled \citep{Taminiau2012Detection}.
These can be found in region $\mathbb{II}$
Control of spins in region $\mathbb{III}$ is not limited by the coherence of the electronic-spin but by that of the nucleus.
These spins cannot be addressed without inventing new methods that significantly improve both electronic- and nuclear- spin coherence.

    \caption{ Schematic representation of different coupling regimes. In the strong coupling regime (region $\mathbb{I}$) carbon-spins are coupled to the NV-center stronger than the coupling of the NV-center to the spin-bath. These carbons can be addressed directly. In the weak coupling regime (region $\mathbb{II}$) carbon-spins are coupled more strongly to the NV-center than to the spin-bath but not strong enough to be addressed directly. In the very-weak coupling regime (region $\mathbb{III}$) the coupling to the spin-bath is stronger than the coupling to the NV-center. These spins cannot be addressed.}
