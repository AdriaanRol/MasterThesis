%weakly coupled carbons in NV- environment provide a naturally occuring spin register making it a promising candidate for QC
% For large scale larger and  deterministically available spin registers are desirable
% here we show deterministic generation of entanglement paving the way for measurement based QEC.
%  Simultations indicate that it is possible to control even more Carbon atoms extending the register and performing full QEC
