Quantum error correction (QEC) is an essential ingredient for scaling up a quantum computer.
The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a promising candidate for such a scalable quantum computer.
This thesis will first explain the tools available to control the NV-center and strongly coupled spins in its environment.
We will then demonstrate how the spin register can be extended by addressing weakly coupled carbon-spins.
The main result of this thesis is the creation of entanglement between two weakly coupled spins, for which initialization, control and read-out is required.
We demonstrate entanglement with a fidelity of  $F = 0.76 \pm  0.02$, well above the quantum limit for an entangled state.
The last chapter will provide an outlook on how the capabilities developed can be extended to implement QEC.
