%weakly coupled carbons in NV- environment provide a naturally occuring spin register making it a promising candidate for QC
% For large scale larger and  deterministically available spin registers are desirable
% here we show deterministic generation of entanglement paving the way for measurement based QEC.
%  Simultations indicate that it is possible to control even more Carbon atoms extending the register and performing full QEC

Quantum Error Correction is an essential ingredient for scaling up a quantum computer.
The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a promising candidate for such a scalable quantum computer.
This thesis will first explain the basic tools available to control the NV-center in diamond and strongly coupled spins in the environment.
We will then demonstrate how the spin register can be extended by addressing weakly coupled carbon-spins.
The main result of this thesis is the creation of entanglement of these weakly coupled spins, for which initialization, control and read-out is required.
We demonstrate entanglement with a fidelity of  $F = 0.76 \pm  0.02$, well above the quantum limit for an entangled state.
The last chapter will provide an outlook on how the capabilities developed can be used to implement QEC.
