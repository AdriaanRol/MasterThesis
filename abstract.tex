%weakly coupled carbons in NV- environment provide a naturally occuring spin register making it a promising candidate for QC
% For large scale larger and  deterministically available spin registers are desirable
% here we show deterministic generation of entanglement paving the way for measurement based QEC.
%  Simultations indicate that it is possible to control even more Carbon atoms extending the register and performing full QEC

[Note: Needs to be rewritten once thesis is done. ]\\
This thesis will discuss the creation of entanglement of weakly coupled spins using parity measurements in the context of quantum error correction.
The first chapter will introduce the project and explain how it fits in the bigger picture.
Chapter 2 will give an overview of the theory and setup needed to understand how the NV-center can be manipulated.
Chapter 3 will explain what weakly-coupled spins are, why it is important to address them and how to address them.
Chapter 4 will go into the control of single and multiple weakly coupled carbons and demonstrate entanglement between them. A feature not previously demonstrated.
Chapter 5 will give an overview of what still needs to be done in order to achieve both deterministic entanglement and the full 3 qubit measurement based Qauntum error correction scheme.
