\section{Identifying weakly-coupled carbon-pins}
This section will discuss the effect of dynamical decoupling on the interaction between the NV-center and weakly coupled nuclear spins.
This is used to explain the features in the fingerprint of \cref{fig:FP} and identify several nuclear spins.

\subsection{The effect of dynamical decoupling on nuclear spins}

During dynamical decoupling the electronic state alternates between the $m_s = 0$ and $m_s =+1$ state, this causes the nuclear spin to alternately rotate around two distinct quantization axes (\cref{fig:quantax}).
When the electron is in the $m_s=0$ state each nuclear spin precesses about $\bm{\omega_L}$ with the Larmor frequency given by \cref{eq:nuclear_larmor} .
When the electron is in the $m_s=+1$ state there is a hyperfine interaction between the nucleus and the NV-center (\cref{eq:nuclear_hamiltonian_1}) and the spin precesses around $\bm{\tilde{\omega}}=\bm{\omega_L} +\bm{A}$, where $\bm{A} = A_\parallel \bm{\hat{z}} + A_\perp \bm{\hat{x}}$ \citep{Taminiau2012Detection}.

For  $m_s=+1$ each spin precesses about a distinct axis $\bm{\tilde{\omega}}=\bm{\omega_L} +\bm{A}$ due to the hyperfine interaction.}

The result of a decoupling sequence is a net rotation around an axis $\bm{\hat{\mathrm{n}}_i}$ by an angle $\theta$.
Where $\bm{\hat{\mathrm{n}}_i}$ depends on the initial state of the electron and $\theta$ is proportional to the number of pulses $N$ \citep{Taminiau2012Detection}.
$\bm{\hat{\mathrm{n}}_i} =\bm{\hat{\mathrm{n}}_0}$ when the electron starts in $m_s = 0$ and $\bm{\hat{\mathrm{n_i}}} =\bm{\hat{\mathrm{n}}_1}$ when the electron starts in $m_s = +1$.

When the net rotation axes point in a different direction a conditional operation is executed during dynamical decoupling (\cref{fig:conditional_and_unconditional_rotation}).
In a dynamical decoupling spectroscopy contrast is lowered when a conditional operation is executed.
To understand when this occurs it is useful to consider three different cases.
A weakly coupled carbon spin in: the trivial regime where $A_\perp=0$, the basic regime where $A_\perp \ll \omega_L$ and the complex regime where $A_\perp \sim \omega_L$.
For a mathematical description of the result of a dynamical decoupling spectroscopy the reader is referred to \cref{sec:mathematical_description_dd_spectro}.

\subsubsection{The trivial regime ($A_\perp=0$)}
Because there is no orthogonal component of the hyperfine the spin will precess around the $z$-axis independent of the initial electronic spin-state.
Therefore the operation not conditional and no signal for such spins is observed in a dynamical decoupling spectroscopy.

\subsubsection{The basic regime ($A_\perp \ll \omega_L$)}
In the basic regime the net rotation axes are practically parallel and point in the $z$-direction for almost every $\tau$ except for a specific resonant condition for which the axes are anti-parallel.
This resonant condition is given by \cref{eq:res_dip_loc}:
 \begin{equation}
\tau = \frac{(2k+1)\pi}{2 \omega_L + A_\parallel}
\label{eq:res_dip_loc}
\end{equation}
Where $k$ is an integer, and has a Lorentzian shape in a dynamical decoupling spectroscopy.
These sharp resonances are the origin of the sharp dips in the dynamical decoupling spectroscopy.
The FWHM of the resonance is given by \cref{eq:res_dip_width}:
 \begin{equation}
\mathrm{FWHM_{DD}} = \frac{A_\perp}{2 \omega_L^2}
\label{eq:res_dip_width}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{The complex regime ($A_\perp \sim \omega_L$)}

In the case where $\bm{\omega_L}$ and $\bm{A_\perp}$ are of comparable magnitude the net rotation axes are strongly dependent on the initial electron-state for almost any $\tau$.
When a carbon is in this regime it is no longer possible to describe it as a narrow resonance in the dynamical decoupling spectroscopy.
The response is visible as a wide resonance with an oscillation on top of it, spin 3 in \cref{fig:FP} is an example of such a spin.

\subsubsection{The combined response of multiple nuclear spins}
Because the electron is not interacting with a single carbon but with a bath of carbon atoms the measured contrast is given by the product the contrasts that would be measured for each spin individually.
Because of this contrast is quickly lost when the responses of multiple carbons overlap.

In order to distinguish an individual carbon-spin its response must not overlap with that of other carbon spins.
By sweeping the number of $\pi$-pules the response of an individual carbon can be distinguished from the response of multiple spins.
Only when an individual spin is being addressed is it possible to sweep the contrast of the dynamical decoupling spectroscopy to -1 by increasing the number of pulses.

\subsection{Identifying Individual Carbon-spins}
Using the previous section we will look at \cref{fig:FP} in greater detail.

A broad collapse of the signal is clearly visible around $\tau/(4\tau_L) = m$ for odd $m$.
This broad collapse is caused by the response of multiple spins overlapping.

At the edges of this collapse several sharp dips are visible.
These correspond to individual spins.
A first estimate of the hyperfine coupling to these spins can be made based on their location and width using \cref{eq:res_dip_loc,eq:res_dip_width}.

Between the broad collapses there alternately appears an oscillation.
This oscillation is caused by a spin in the complex regime.
Its position can be used to get a rough estimate for its hyperfine coupling.

By computing the responses for the hyperfine parameters using \cref{eq:contrast_single_carbon_spin} a more accurate estimation was made.
13 distinct carbon spins were identified.

The parameters of the 4 strongest coupled carbons are listed in \cref{tbl:HF_par} and their computed responses are visible as colored lines in \cref{fig:FP}.
All estimated hyperfine parameters and a link to the full dynamical decoupling dataset can be found in \cref{chap:Fingerprint_data_appendix}.
