\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Quantum Computing}
% Paragraph: Quantum is cool because exponential scale up allowing previously unaitainable problems

%Look up TJ Ladd et al. 2010 nature. On exponential speedup and entanglement as key resource.

% Proof of concept exists (+ examples of basic algorithms) but key challenge is scaling it up

% Different systems and approaches, highlight node based and NV-

%  Key ingredients entanglement and dynamical operations (based on outcome of measurements)

%  Highlight Issue with errors as challenge and highlight threshold theorem

\section{Quantum Error Correction}
% Note Stabilizers not in there
% Explain idea of Quantum Error correction,

% Explain that Quantum Error Correction might allow for reaching threshold

% Key ingredients to performing Error Correction; Creating Entanglement and dynamical operations.

\section{Weakly coupled carbons; a naturally occuring register }
% Normally a source of errors (decoherence) weakly coupled carbons in the environment of the NV provide a naturally occuring register of qubits that can be used for QEC.

% Has been shown that they can be addressed and controlled (paper of Tim)

% Gate based QEC has been shown.
% Q: Why is this not full QEC? Don't need deterministic gates/FFWD?

% In this thesis we will show coherent control of weakly coupled carbons and deterministic entanglement creation.


% Notes, think of use of word parity and entanglement
