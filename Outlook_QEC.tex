\chapter{Outlook: towards Quantum Error Correction}
This thesis has demonstrated the probabilistic creation of entangled states between weakly-coupled carbon spins.
This chapter will provide an outlook on how the tools developed can be used to implement quantum error correction.
It will also discuss the feasibility of using weakly-coupled carbon spins as a means to enlarge NV-spin registers in general

\section{Direct outlook, deterministic operations/what needs to be done/can be done}

\section{Simulations, how many carbon can we control? }
