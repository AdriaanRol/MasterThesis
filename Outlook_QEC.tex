\chapter{Towards Quantum Error Correction}
This thesis demonstrated the creation of entanglement between weakly coupled carbon spins.
To implement 3-qubit QEC more spins are required as well as the ability to perform deterministic operations.

\section{Feed Forward}
Another capability required for QEC is the ability to perform different quantum operations based on a classical readout result.
An example of such an experiment is the deterministic creation of entanglement.
By applying an extra set of gates when the negative parity result is measured it can be transformed in the state that would have been created had the positive parity been measured.
These extra gates can be absorbed into the tomography when desired.

Such an experiment can be implemented using current methods.
The main challenge lies in computing what operations must be done to correct for the negative readout.

An additional advantage of performing deterministic operations is that it can significantly speed up the rate at which experiments can be performed as it is no longer limited by part of the probabilistic initialization.


\section{Simulations}
In order to implement QEC more than the two qubits must be addressed.
To correct for a single type of quantum error 3 qubits are required.
To correct for any type of quantum error at least 5 qubits are required.
By having more qubits more elegant algorithms exist for correcting quantum errors.

\subsection{Working of the simulations}
Simulations were performed to determine how many weakly coupled carbons can be addressed using dynamical decoupling.
In the simulations statistics were collected on 1000 NV-centers for a range of magnetic fields and three different carbon-13 concentrations.
All NV-centers have an environment consisting of randomly placed carbon-13 spins.
NV-centers containing a carbon with a hyperfine coupling larger than 200kHz were rejected as these are hard to simulate, and are expected to contain few addressable carbons.
In an experimental setting these carbons can be easily detected and the samples rejected.
On the remaining 299 samples the hyperfine coupling between each carbon and the NV-center as well as the resonance conditions of these carbons were calculated.
At these resonances it was determined if a carbon is addressable.

A weakly coupled carbon is considered addressable if two consecutive $\pm \mathrm{x}$ gates can be implemented with a fidelity of 90\% or higher and at least 10 $\pm \mathrm{x}$ gates can be implemented within the coherence time.

The fidelity is determined by sweeping the number of pulses at the resonance conditions and determining with what fidelity the electronic spin state can be inverted.
The accuracy with which the resonance can be addressed is limited by the resolution of the arbitrary waveform generator of 1ns.
The fidelity is determined under the assumption of perfect $\pi$ and $\pi/2$-pulses and includes no decoherence effects.

When the gate time ($N\cdot\tau$) is larger than 1/10th the coherence time the spin is said to be unaddressable.
The coherence time $T_2^* $ is simplified to be a constant\footnote{It should be noted that this is an oversimplification and a typical coherence time does not exist for a NV-center\citep{Dobrovitski2008Decoherence}} based on the carbon-13 concentration ($\mu$), and is set at the values listed in \cref{tbl:concentration_Tmaxes}.

The electronic-spin coherence is protected by dynamical decoupling during the gates.
When the inter pulse delay becomes longer the protection becomes weaker.
To ensure good protection against decoherence resonances at $\tau$ larger than a certain $\tau_\mathrm{max}$ were not considered.
$\tau_{\mathrm{max}}$ is set at the values listed in \cref{tbl:concentration_Tmaxes}.

\subsection{Results of the simulation}
\Cref{fig:Simulation_results} shows the results of the simulations.
\Cref{fig:Simulations_avg_n_vs_bfield} shows the average number of addressable carbon spins as a function of magnetic field.
The number of addressable carbons increases quickly at first before a slow decay sets in.

The initial increase in the number of addressable carbons can be explained by the Larmor frequency becoming larger than the hyperfine interaction.
At low magnetic field most spins are in the complex regime, causing their responses to overlap in a dynamical decoupling spectroscopy.
When the Larmor frequency becomes larger than their hyperfine coupling they move into the simple regime where the resonances are narrow.
Because there is less overlap more spins can be addressed.
This increase drops off because eventually all spins are in the simple regime.

At lower concentrations there are on average less spins in the complex regime for the same magnetic field.
This causes the initial increase to be steeper at lower concentrations.

By increasing the magnetic field further the resonances both get narrower (\cref{eq:res_dip_width}) and move to shorter times \cref{eq:res_dip_loc}.
When the field becomes to high a resonance can become to narrow for the arbitrary waveform generator to accurately address.

There is also a bias due to the rejection of carbons with $|A|>200\mathrm{kHz}$.
Not rejecting these carbons will lower the number of addressable carbons for low magnetic fields as the response of these carbons dominates the dynamical decoupling spectroscopy, while the number of addressable carbons will increase slightly in the high field limit were these carbons can be controlled trough dynamical decoupling.

% LONGER COHERENCE TIME
% When the concentration is lower the average separation between carbons and between carbons and the NV- centre is larger. This means that the coherence times are longer and that the coupling between a carbon and the NV- centre is on average weaker.

% OVERLAP
% One would expect that having less carbon atoms means less overlap in the resonances. Having less carbons might mean losing an easy to address carbon that is located close by. This effect is countered by also having some relatively weakly coupled carbons removed reducing overlap in resonances. The exact balance between these two effects depends on the configuration of each individual NV- centre.

% LONGER GATE TIMES
% Because the carbon atoms are coupled more weakly the magnetic field that is required before they can be resonantly addressed is much smaller. The downside of the weaker coupling is that the time it takes to implement a gate is much larger. Longer coherence times allow for longer gate times.

% LONGER RES TIME ALLOWED
% Because the longer coherence time a longer inter-pulse delay is allowed. This allows higher order peaks to be addressed at low magnetic fields. This allows additional carbon atoms to be controlled at low magnetic fields.

% DECLINE
% Eventually the dips become too narrow to address with the AWG. Because the width of the dips (\autoref{eq:res_dip_width}) depends on the strength of the coupling we expect this decline to set in earlier for lower concentrations as the carbons that are addressed are on average weaker coupled.


\paragraph{ }
\Cref{fig:simulations_histogram_vs_Bfield} shows the distribution of addressable carbons for a natural concentration of carbon-13 at the optimal magnetic field.
It indicates that in most samples (89\%) 3 or more carbons can be addressed and that in a reasonable fraction (57\%) of the samples 5 or more carbons can be addressed.
There are even rare occurrences where $\sim 10$ carbons can be addressed.

% % %%%%%%%%%
% Idem:

% Spins that have a stronger than average hyperfine-interaction show up outside or at the edge of the spin-bath collapse.
% Spins that are in the basic regime show up as a narrow dip.
% Going to larger $\tau$ separates these dips further as the order of the resonance $k$ increases.
% By looking at larger $\tau$ it is possible to resolve and address more resonances.
% Several spins in the basic regime have been identified 3 of these are visible as colored lines in \cref{fig:FP}.
% As computations are fundamentally limited by the coherence time there is a limit to the resonance-order that can be used to address carbons, making it impossible to resolve all weakly coupled spins.

% Besides the carbons in the basic regime there are also weakly-coupled carbons that are more strongly coupled.
% When a carbon in the complex regime is present in the NV-center this manifests itself as a resonance with strong oscillations on the side. Such a feature is also clearly visible in \cref{fig:FP}. We have identified the oscillations in the fingerprint as belong to a single spin which is denoted by the red line.

% When a weakly coupled carbon in the complex regime is present a significant part of the fingerprint spectrum is inaccessible for controlling other carbons making them an undesired feature when attempting to control weakly coupled carbon spins.



% Moved from identification section:
% \subsection{Effect of the magnetic field}

% Although increasing the magnetic field can improve the situation it is not always possible or desired.
% When the magnetic field becomes too strong too strong the resonances become narrower than the resolution of the Arbitrary Waveform Generator used to generate the pulses that address the resonances, making it impossible to address these resonances effectively.
% Simulations were performed (see \cref{chap:addressable_carbon_sims}) that indicate that for a natural carbon-13 concentration there is a range between 400G and 1400G where the magnetic field is optimal for controlling weakly coupled spins.

% Besides the spin environment there are other factors affecting the choice for magnetic field.
% Because the optical transitions used for readout and initialization depend on strain and magnetic field field\citep{Hensen2011MeasurementBased}, care must be taken when measuring that states do not mix in the excited state.
% This combined with the fact that few experiments have been performed at high magnetic field and low temperature make it more practical to settle for a more moderate magnetic field of 300G.
