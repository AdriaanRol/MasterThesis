\input{Introduction.tex}
% Gives motivation for doing parity measurements based on the importance of QEC
% Clearly ending in several key requirements for the experiments:
        %  Control of enough qubits /carbons
        %  Feed forward -> Deterministic gates and dynamical operations
        %  Parity measurements
\input{Electronic_spin_in_diamond.tex}
% Chapter elaborates on general electronic spin control and the architecture of a typical experiment
\input{Controlling_weakly_coupled_carbon_spins.tex}
% Consists of several sub chapters
    %  theory of how weakly coupled carbons can be controlled
    %  Experiments used to characterize the environment and carbons
    %  Theory of initialization and readout of carbons
    %  Experiments showing single and multiple carbon initialization and readout
\input{Deterministic_MBE.tex}
%  Entanglement verification as test to check both feed forward and parity measurements
% Experiment (hopefully) showing F>0.5 to Bell state.
\input{Outlook_QEC.tex}
%  Outlook what more is needed for QEC
%  Short term outlook that indicates usefull 3 qubit QEC circuits
% Simulations showing long term outlook for quantum nodes
