Questions I should be able to answer for my defense:

Are few weakly coupled carbon spins better than strongly coupled carbon spins? Why?
How are the error-bars on all the graphs calculated?
How and why does dynamical decoupling work?
How many lattice side away can we ignore the contact term of the hyperfine? How fast does it drop off?

In the description for the hyperfine interactions, how is the n_hf defined?

How does changing from ms=-1 to ms=+1 affect the experiments and calculations?
