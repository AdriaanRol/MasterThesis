Questions I should be able to answer for my defense:

Are few weakly coupled carbon spins better than strongly coupled carbon spins? Why?
How are the error-bars on all the graphs calculated?
How and why does dynamical decoupling work?
How many lattice side away can we ignore the contact term of the hyperfine? How fast does it drop off?

In the description for the hyperfine interactions, how is the n_hf defined?

How does changing from ms=-1 to ms=+1 affect the experiments and calculations?

In this string of carbon-13  dopants how far should these be separated and how accurate should they be positioned?

Dynamical decoupling only works on tau larmor
why is it not practical to compensate for arbitrary strongly coupled carbons.



####Practice excercises
Work out Hamiltonian of NV- center for practice
Schaling T2* met concetratie (wortel mu of lineair met mu) Terug naar discussie met 3 month report

Work out complex-regime carbons. Why do they give oscillations?
Similarly, how would a strongly coupled spin (such as nitrogen) show up? A: broadening of oscillation, not doing right pi pulse so oscillation over entire spectrum?
